# This is kmom01

[//]: # (Har du jobbat med ramverk eller andra CMS:er tidigare?)

I have worked with different frameworks before starting this course.

I have started to build my own website with the JavaScript framework
Gatsby. The project is currently on hold but can be viewed here:
[https://www.sönnerberg.se](https://www.xn--snnerberg-07a.se/).
To create the website I have followed a guide on
[FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/build-a-developer-blog-from-scratch-with-gatsby-and-mdx/).

I have also just finished the project for `jsramverk` (but not handed it in yet).
It can be viewed here: [Home](https://trading.sonnerberg.me/). In this project
I have been using
[React – A JavaScript library for building user interfaces](https://reactjs.org/)
and [Apollo GraphQL | Apollo Data Graph Platform— unify APIs, microservices, and databases into a data graph that you can query with GraphQL](https://www.apollographql.com/).

I have also used [mosbth/anax: Next generation Anax, v3.0, builds upon Anax MVC.](https://github.com/mosbth/anax)
a little bit earlier. I did not finished the design course or oophp last year
so I am not comfortable with Anax.

I have also dabbled with Less and Sass before. In my project for `jsramverk`
I used sass like syntax with [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/).

[//]: # (Det blev en del nya verktyg och tekniker i labbmiljön och för att jobba med portfolio-sidan, är du bekant med någon av dem sedan tidigare?)

I am familiar with most of the tools and techniques that were introduced in kmom01.

I had not heard of [Pico - A stupidly simple, blazing fast, flat file CMS.](http://picocms.org/)
before, but I am glad that we are using it in the course because it seems interesting.

This time around studying this course I am more confident in my abilities. Earlier
I felt overwhelmed when reading the documentation for [mosbth/cimage: Server-side image resizing and cropping on the fly with caching of generated image-files using PHP.](https://github.com/mosbth/cimage) but this time
around I felt comfortable trying it out.

[//]: # (Har du några förutfattade meningar, eller kanske etablerad övertygelse, inom design och användbarhet för webben?)

When it comes to preconcieved notions I don't have too many. I really find the
idea of not using media queries at all very interesting. This is an idea
that I have picked up from the book [Relearn CSS layout: Every Layout](https://every-layout.dev/)
but I have not had the time to properly go through it. I will most likely
continue to use media queries but I will also try my best to try some
of the techniques mentioned in [Relearn CSS layout: Every Layout](https://every-layout.dev/).

[//]: # (Hur kändes det att göra din egna layout och styla den? Gick det bra?)

It felt okay to create my own layout and styling it. I copied the theme
from dbwebb and applied some modifications to it.

[//]: # (Vilken är din TIL för detta kmom?)

My Today I Learned (TIL) for this course component is something that I
actually relearned. I managed to set up `apache` and `php` without
XAMPP on two linux machines (my laptop and desktop) with some help
from a teacher on discord.
