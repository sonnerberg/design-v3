Hello, I'm Richard.

I am, at the time of writing this, 34 years old and I live in Helsingborg,
Sweden.

While studying at BTH I am usually working full time. At the moment I
am on parental leave until June 2021.

Being on parental leave actually leaves me with less time studying
compared to when I am at work. When I am working I have a few hours every
day where I am off and I usually use that time to study.

I am actually a year 2 student but I have a few bits and pieces to pick
up for courses held during year 1. So my main goal this year is to pass
all the courses for year 1 and do as much as I can in the courses for
year 2

I have been studying web development since 2017 with a term at
EC-utbildning's Frontend Developer as the starting point. From there
I have mostly been studying at BTH while doing courses at FreeCodeCamp,
Coursera and EDX at the same time. I have also completed a number of
courses at other Swedish Universities, mostly in JavaScript.

I started out programming in Python but at the moment I am most accustomed
to JavaScript. I am not comfortable in php as I have only done php programming
in `htmlphp` which I passed in 2018. I look forward to learning more php,
python and JavaScript and for all of this programming a solid foundation
in design is needed. I also look forward to learning more design and I
have a book that I can hopefully lean on a bit because I find it very
interesting. The book is called
[Relearn CSS layout: Every Layout](https://every-layout.dev/).
